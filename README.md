# TuteDude-Python
A collection of simple Python scripts demonstrating fundamental concepts like file handling, error management, and list manipulation.

Description
This repository contains solutions to common beginner Python programming problems. Each script is self-contained and focuses on a specific task.

Scripts Included
1. File Reading with Error Handling (file_reader.py)
Purpose: This script demonstrates how to safely open and read a text file (sample.txt).

Features:

Reads the file line by line and prints the content.

Uses a try...except block to gracefully handle a FileNotFoundError if sample.txt does not exist, preventing the program from crashing.

2. File Writing and Appending (file_writer.py)
Purpose: This script shows the process of writing to a file, adding more content, and then reading it back.

Features:

Prompts the user for input and writes it to output.txt using write mode ('w').

Appends a predefined line to the same file using append mode ('a').

Reads the entire modified file and displays its final content to the console.

3. List Slicing and Reversing (list_slicing.py)
Purpose: This script showcases basic list manipulation techniques in Python.

Features:

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

Uses list slicing ([:5]) to extract the first five elements.

Demonstrates how to reverse the extracted portion using extended slice syntax ([::-1]).

Prints the original, extracted, and reversed lists.
